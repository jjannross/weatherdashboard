# weatherdashboard

This app allows a user to search for a city then displays the current weather for designated city. Two APIs are used to obtain the current days forecast, including a UV Index which is indicated to be low(green), unfavorable (yellow), or dangerous (red). A forecast for the next 5 days is provided as well.
